It's a place where friendships are forged over late-night gaming sessions and where the entire spectrum of digital entertainment comes together under one roof for a weekend of pure, unadulterated fun.\n\nWhile the full slate of activities is still being unveiled, we can expect the classic Dreamhack experience, dialed up to eleven. The event is slated to take place at the renowned Stockholmsmässan, providing ample space for multiple esports stages, a vast LAN area, and zones dedicated to everything from retro gaming to the latest in VR technology. Key attractions will undoubtedly include major tournaments in titles like Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT, alongside community stages, panels with industry icons, and the chance to go hands-on with unreleased games. Tickets will likely be available in several tiers, from single-day passes to the coveted LAN pass that grants you a seat for the entire weekend.\n\nThe return of Dreamhack to Stockholm is more than just a logistical move; it's a powerful statement. It signifies a renewed commitment to the festival's roots and the passionate community that started it all. This event will be a convergence point for players, creators, developers, and fans from across the globe, all united by a shared love for gaming.

As Shahin Zarrabi, our VP of Festivals, perfectly stated, \"This is what DreamHack is all about, we're leveling the playing field. Nothing matters except bringing your computer, showing your skill, and rising to fame.” DreamHack Knockout strips away the barriers, creating an ecosystem where merit is the only currency. It’s a return to the roots of esports, a pure and unfettered contest where aspiring legends can prove their worth in the heat of live, in-person battle.\n\nMark your calendars for two landmark events.\n\nDreamHack Atlanta:October 31 to November 2, 2025, with 32 teams competing for a $10,000 prize pool and a coveted spot in ESL Pro League Season 23.\n\nDreamHack Stockholm:November 28 to 30, 2025, where a massive 128-team bracket will offer the same prize pool and another direct qualification to EPL Season 23.\n\nParticipation is open to any attendee with a BYOC ticket, making this a truly accessible pathway to the professional circuit.\n\nIn conclusion, DreamHack Knockout is more than just a competition;it is a promise. It is the promise that skill, dedication, and passion are what truly define a champion. By connecting our beloved LAN culture directly to the pinnacle of professional play, we are not only creating exciting new content but also nurturing the next generation of esports superstars, proving that the journey from a BYOC seat to a global arena is not just possible, but within reach.\n\nAs members of the ESL FACEIT Group family, this is a story we should all be excited to tell.
