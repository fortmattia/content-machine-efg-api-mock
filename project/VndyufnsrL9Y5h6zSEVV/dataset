We are thrilled to unveil DreamHack Knockout, a revolutionary competition that forges a direct path from the festival floor to the global stage. This initiative, launching at DreamHack Atlanta and DreamHack Stockholm in 2025, embodies the very spirit of our company, creating tangible opportunities for every Counter-Strike 2 player to turn their passion into a professional career. It’s a bold statement, reinforcing DreamHack's legacy as the ultimate festival for the gaming lifestyle.\n\nAt its heart, DreamHack Knockout is about democratizing the competitive ecosystem. It’s a direct, in-person pathway for any player, whether a seasoned veteran or an undiscovered talent, to earn a coveted spot in the ESL Pro League, the world's most prestigious CS2 league. As Shahin Zarrabi, VP Festivals at ESL FACEIT Group, perfectly stated, “This is what DreamHack is all about, we're leveling the playing field. Nothing matters except bringing your computer, showing your skill, and rising to fame. No bells and whistles, just raw and unfettered competition.” This is the embodiment of the \"zero-to-hero\" dream, made real.\n\nThe journey to stardom will unfold at two of our flagship festivals next year, each boasting a $10,000 prize pool. First, DreamHack Atlanta will host 32 teams from October 31 to November 2, 2025, with the grand final on Sunday determining who qualifies for ESL Pro League Season 23. The action then moves to DreamHack Stockholm from November 28 to 30, 2025, where a massive 128-team bracket will offer a second slot in the very same EPL season. Participation is open to anyone with a BYOC ticket, ensuring that the only barrier to entry is the determination to compete.\n\nThis initiative is more than just a tournament; it's a testament to our core belief in the power of open competition and the magic that happens when the entire gaming community comes together. DreamHack Knockout bridges the gap between the grassroots passion of the BYOC LAN and the pinnacle of professional esports, creating a powerful and direct link within our ecosystem. For two teams in 2025, it will be a life-changing weekend, proving that greatness can truly come from anywhere.\n\nAs members of the EFG family, this is a story we can all be proud to champion. We encourage you to share this exciting news with your networks and help us spread the word throughout the global gaming community. Let's direct aspiring champions and passionate fans to dreamhack.com/atlanta and dreamhack.com/stockholm to secure their tickets and find more information. Together, we are not just hosting events; we are building dreams and defining the future of esports.",
